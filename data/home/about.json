    "At Emory University, I study Applied Mathematics and Statistics under the mentorship of Prof. Ruoxuan Xiong.",
    "My research broadly focuses on building reliable machine learning systems under uncertainty, particularly in settings with bias, incomplete data, or distributional shifts. I am interested in methodological questions around uncertainty quantification, robustness, and missing data, and I often draw on causal and statistical perspectives when they are useful for understanding model behavior.",
    "I have worked on a range of applied problems—including multimodal healthcare modeling, applied NLP, and sequential decision-making—which has allowed me to study these reliability challenges across different domains and modeling paradigms."
